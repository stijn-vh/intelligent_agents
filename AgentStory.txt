Once upon an evening, a married couple, Sarah and Micheal, decided to have a delightful dinner together at their favorite local Italian restaurant, “La Trattoria” located in Amsterdam. Although Sarah and Micheal were just 17, they had been married for a year now. Micheal, who was 17, was a strict vegetarian due to his strong ethical beliefs, while Sarah, also 17, was a pescatarian, although she recently found out that she was severely allergic to seafood.
They arrived at the restaurant at 10:30 PM, which was peculiar as typically such places closed by 10 PM in their town. Regardless, they were seated and began perusing the menu under the soft glow of the table candle. Sarah was a diabetic and had to be mindful of her sugar intake, especially when it came to dessert.
Micheal ordered some sushi while Sarah decided on a shrimp scampi and they also decided to share a bottle of red wine. As they awaited their meal, they engaged in warm conversation under the starry night sky. Despite their odd circumstances, they cherished these little escapes.
When dessert time arrived, Sarah ordered a sugar-laden tiramisu. The night wrapped up with an inconsistent melody of dietary dissonance, as the couple headed home under the veil of the quiet night, contemplating the enigmatic blend of their youthful whims and the obscure framework of their existence.
